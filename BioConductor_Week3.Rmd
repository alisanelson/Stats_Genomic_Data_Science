## Question 1: What is the mean expression across all features for sample 5 in the ALL dataset (from the ALL package)?

1. Download BioBase and ALL data packages
2. Subset all features of sample 5
3. Take mean of subset


```{r Question 1}
library(ALL)
data(ALL)
ALL
ALL_sample5 <- exprs(ALL)[, 5]
mean(ALL_sample5)

```

## Question 2: annotate each feature of the ALL dataset with the Ensembl gene id. How many probesets (features) are annotated with more than one Ensembl gene id?

1. Download biomaRt package
2. get Ensembl version specified in quiz: 𝚖𝚊𝚛𝚝 <- 𝚞𝚜𝚎𝙼𝚊𝚛𝚝(𝚑𝚘𝚜𝚝='𝚏𝚎𝚋𝟸𝟶𝟷𝟺.𝚊𝚛𝚌𝚑𝚒𝚟𝚎.𝚎𝚗𝚜𝚎𝚖𝚋𝚕.𝚘𝚛𝚐', 𝚋𝚒𝚘𝚖𝚊𝚛𝚝 = "𝙴𝙽𝚂𝙴𝙼𝙱𝙻_𝙼𝙰𝚁𝚃_𝙴𝙽𝚂𝙴𝙼𝙱𝙻")
3. load hg19 dataset
4. Build query for annotation of all features (values = features, attribute = gene ids,affyids filter = Affymatrix probe ids (affy_hg_u95av2))
5. download dplyr package for group_by in data frame.
6. group result by affy id and add integer count
7. sum

```{r Question 2}
library(biomaRt)
𝚖𝚊𝚛𝚝 <- 𝚞𝚜𝚎𝙼𝚊𝚛𝚝(𝚑𝚘𝚜𝚝='𝚌𝚑𝚒𝚟𝚎.𝚎𝚗𝚜𝚎𝚖𝚋𝚕.𝚘𝚛𝚐', 𝚋𝚒𝚘𝚖𝚊𝚛𝚝 = "𝙴𝙽𝚂𝙴𝙼𝙱𝙻_𝙼𝙰𝚁𝚃_𝙴𝙽𝚂𝙴𝙼𝙱𝙻")
ensembl <- useDataset("hsapiens_gene_ensembl", mart)
dat <- exprs(ALL)
affyids <- rownames(dat)
getBM(attributes = c("ensembl_gene_id", "affy_hg_u95av2"),
      filters = "affy_hg_u95av2", values = affyids, mart = ensembl)
prob_set <- mapping %>%
+     group_by (affy_hg_u95av2) %>%
+     summarise(
+         prob_count = n()
+     )
> head(prob_set)
sum(prob_set$prob_count > 1)
```

## Question 3: How many probesets (Affymetrix IDs) are annotated with one or more genes on the autosomes (chromosomes 1 to 22)
1. Do query again including chromosome_name as an attribute
2. Subset query result to exclude "X", "Y" and any other nonstandard chromosome
Sum length

```{r Question 3:}

getBM(attributes = c("ensembl_gene_id", "affy_hg_u95av2", "chromosome_name"),
+       filters = "affy_hg_u95av2", values = affyids, mart = ensembl)
mapping_autosome <- subset(mapping2, chromosome_name != "X")
mapping_autosome <- subset(mapping2, chromosome_name != "Y")

```

## Question 4: What is the mean value of the Methylation channel across the features for sample “5723646052_R04C01”?

```{r Question 4}
library(minfiData)
data("MsetEx")
pData(MsetEx) #desired sample is [,2]
?MsetEx
> R04C01_sample <- MsetEx[,2]
> mean(getMeth(R04C01_sample))
```

## Question 5: Access the processed data from NCBI GEO Accession number GSE788. What is the mean expression level of sample GSM9024?

1. Dowload GEOquery package
2. library(Geoquery)
3. Get processed data GSE788
4. Find sample names and feature data
5. Subset expression level and sample "GSM9024"
6. Find mean of expression level

```{r Question 5}
library(GEOquery)
q5_geo <- getGEO("GSE788")
class(q5_geo)
length(q5_geo)
names(q5_geo)
pData(q5_data) #ID sample index number
GSE788 <- exprs(q5_data)[,2]
> mean(GSE788)

```

## Question 6: What is the average of the average length across the samples in the expriment?

1. Download airway package + dataset
2. find mean of airway$avgLength

```{r Question 6}
library(airway)
> data("airway")
> airway
 colData(airway)
 mean(airway$avgLength)
```

## Question 7: What is the number of Ensembl genes which have a count of 1 read or more in sample SRR1039512?

```{r Question 7}
library(airway)
data("airway")
airway
q7_sub <- airway[,3]
counts <- assay(q7_sub, "counts")
sum(counts>=1)
```

##Question 8: The airway dataset contains more than 64k features. How many of these features overlaps with transcripts on the autosomes (chromosomes 1-22) as represented by the TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene package? **exons only

1. Get Txdb package
2. Get exons from txdb
3. Subset exons to autosomes
4. Change seqlevels from "chr_" to "_" to match airway GRanges
4. Find overlaps between airway and exons subset

``` {r Question 8}
library("TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene")
txdb <- TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene
txdb_exons <- exons(txdb)
txdb_exons <- keepStandardChromosomes(txdb_exons, pruning.mode = "coarse")
> txdb_exons_auto <- dropSeqlevels(txdb_exons, c("chrX", "chrY", "chrM"), pruning.mode = "coarse")
newStyle <- mapSeqlevels(seqlevels(txdb_exons_auto), "NCBI")
> exons_tx <- renameSeqlevels(txdb_exons_auto, newStyle)
> subsetByOverlaps(airway, exons_tx)
```

##Question 9: For sample SRR1039508, how big a percentage (expressed as a number between 0 and 1) of the total reads in the airway dataset for that sample, are part of a feature which overlaps an autosomal TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene transcript?

1. subset sample SRR1039508 (airway [,1]) 
2. overlap subset SRR1039508 with exons_tx
3. find counts for both the whole sample and the overlaps with exons
4. Divide subset_counts / total counts for sample SRR1039508

``` {r Question 9}
q9 <- airway[,1]
subset_SRR1039508 <- subsetByOverlaps(q9, exons_tx)
subset_counts <- assay(subset_SRR1039508, "counts")
counts <- assay(q9, "counts")
sum(subset_counts) / sum(counts)
```

##Question 10: What is the median number of counts per feature (for sample SRR1039508) containing a H3K4me narrowPeak in their promoter (only features which overlap autosomal transcripts from TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene are considered)?

1. Obtain H3K4me sample for lung tissue: E096
2. reduce to autosomes only
3. change seqLevels to match airway ("1" instead of "chr1")
4. Extract ranges from subset_SRR1039508 (subset of sample that overlaps exons)
5. Identify promoters in sample subset
6. Overlap promoter range with H3K4me
7. Find overlap between above step and whole sample SRR1039508
8. Extract count numbers from overlapping ranges
9. Take mean of overlap counts

``` {r Question 10}
ahub = AnnotationHub()
qhs = subset(ahub, "H3K4me")
qhs = subset(qhs, "E096") #narrow peaks
qhs1 <-  qhs[["AH30595"]]
qhs1 <- keepSeqlevels(qhs1, autosome, pruning.mode = "coarse")
> qhs1 <- renameSeqlevels(h1, ncbiStyleLevels)
qhs1 <- renameSeqlevels(qhs1, newStyle)
> sample_range <- range(rowRanges(subset_SRR1039508))
> auto_ncbi <- extractSeqlevelsByGroup(species="Homo sapiens", style="NCBI", group="auto")
> sample_range <- keepSeqlevels(sample_range, auto_ncbi)
> prom <- promoters(sample_range)
ov_prom_qhs <- subsetByOverlaps(prom, qhs1)
sample_ov <- subsetByOverlaps(q9, ov_prom_qhs)
ov_counts <- assay(sample_ov, "counts")
mean(ov_counts)

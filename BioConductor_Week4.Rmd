##Question 1: What fraction of reads in this file has an A nucleotide in the 5th base of the read?

Intent: Isolate 5th base of each read in Fastq file and find A / total
1. download data set and use given code to extract fastq file
2. store fastq file path, use ShortRead package to extract ID, sequence, and quality scores
3. Import sequence reads into a matrix, columns for base number, rows for sequence number


```{r Question 1}
library(yeastRNASeq)
fastqFilePath <- system.file("reads", "wt_1_f.fastq.gz", package = "yeastRNASeq")
library(ShortRead)
fqFile <- FastqFile(fastqPath)
reads <- readFastq(fqFile)
sread(reads)[1:2]
reads_matrix <- as(sread(reads), "matrix")
sum(reads_matrix[,5] == "A")/length(reads)
```

## Question 2: What is the average numeric quality value of the 5th base of these reads?

1. create matrix of fastq quality scores
2. take average of quality_matrix[,5]


```{r Question 2}
quality_matrix <- as(quality(reads), "matrix")
mean(quality_matrix[,5])
```

## Question 3: In below interval, how many reads are duplicated by position?
Extra info: We will focus on the interval from 800,000 to 801,000 on yeast chromosome 13. A read duplicated by position is a read where at least one more read shares the same position.

1. Get data package
2. Isolate interval by making GRange for chr13 and specified interval and using ScanBamParam to store interval data
3. use duplicated() to identify reads with duplicated positions (duplicated() determines which elements of a vector or data frame are duplicates of elements with smaller subscripts, and returns a logical vector indicating which elements (rows) are duplicates.)
4. Store values of duplicated positions
5. Add number of duplicates found



```{r Question 3}
library(leeBamViews)
bamFilePath <- system.file("bam", "isowt5_13e.bam", package="leeBamViews")
library(Rsamtools)
bamFile <- BamFile(bamFilePath)
aln <- scanBam(bamFile)
aln <- aln[[1]]
names(aln)
lapply(aln, function(xx) xx[1])
gr <- GRanges(seqnames = "Scchr13",
              ranges = IRanges(start = 800000, end = 801000))
params <- ScanBamParam(which = gr, what = scanBamWhat())
aln <- scanBam(bamFile, param = params)
aln <- aln[[1]]
duplicatedValues = unique(aln$pos[duplicated(aln$pos)])
sum(aln$pos %in% duplicatedValues)
```

##Question 4: What is the average number of reads across the 8 samples falling in this interval?
Extra info: An objective of the original paper was the discovery of novel transcribed regions in yeast. One such region is Scchr13:807762-808068.

1. Trying to construct view of multiple files so use BamViews
2. 

```{r Question 4}
bpaths <- list.files(system.file("bam", package="leeBamViews"), pattern = "bam$", full=TRUE)
bamView <- BamViews(bpaths)
gr <- GRanges(seqnames = "Scchr13",
              ranges = IRanges(start = 807762, end = 808068))
bamRanges(bamView) <- gr
aln <- scanBam(bamView)
names(aln)
names(aln[[1]])
lens <- list()
for(i in 1:length(aln)) {
  lens[i] <- length(aln[[i]][[1]]$seq)
}
mean(unlist(lens))
```

##Question 5: What is the average expression across samples in the control group for the “8149273” probeset (this is a character identifier, not a row number)

```{r Question 5}
library(c(oligo, GEOquery))
getGEOSuppFiles("GSE38792")
list.files("GSE38792")
untar("GSE38792/GSE38792_RAW.tar", exdir = "GSE38792/CEL")
list.files("GSE38792/CEL")
celfiles <- list.files("GSE38792/CEL", full = TRUE)
rawData <- read.celfiles(celfiles)

#clean up raw data
filename <- sampleNames(rawData)
pData(rawData)$filename <- filename
sampleNames <- sub(".*_", "", filename)
sampleNames <- sub(".CEL.gz$", "", sampleNames)
sampleNames(rawData) <- sampleNames
pData(rawData)$group <- ifelse(grepl("^OSA", sampleNames(rawData)),
                               "OSA", "Control")

#normalize
normData <- rma(rawData)
expr <- exprs(normData)
mean(expr["8149273",1:8])
```

## Question 6: What is the absolute value of the log foldchange (𝚕𝚘𝚐𝙵𝙲) of the gene with the lowest 𝙿.𝚟𝚊𝚕𝚞e
extra info: Use the limma package to fit a two group comparison between the control group and the OSA group, and borrow strength across the genes using 𝚎𝙱𝚊𝚢𝚎𝚜(). Include all 18 samples in the model fit.

```{r: Question 6}
```

##Question 8: What is the mean difference in beta values between the 3 normal samples and the 3 cancer samples, across OpenSea CpGs?

```{r Question 8}
library(minfi)
library(minfiData)
data("RGsetEx")
RGset_data <- preprocessFunnorm(RGsetEx)
beta_RG <- getBeta(RGset_data)
cpgs <- getIslandStatus(RGset_data)
pData(RGset_data)$status
norm <- beta_RG[,c(1,2,5)]
can <- beta_RF[,c(3,4,6)]
norm_os <- norm[cpgs == "OpenSea",]
can_os <- can[cpgs == "OpenSea",]
mean(norm_os) - mean(can_os)
```

##Question 9: How many of these DNase hypersensitive sites contain one or more CpGs on the 450k array?
Extra info: The Caco2 cell line is a colon cancer cell line profiled by ENCODE. Obtain the narrowPeak DNase hyper sensitive sites computed by the analysis working group (AWG).

1. Obtain data from Annotation Hub


```{r Question 9}
ahub <- AnnotationHub()
qah_h1 <- query(ahub, c("Caco2", "AWG"))
qah_h1 <- qah_h1[[1]]
#ahub <- subset(ahub, genome == "hg19")
#ahub_s <- subset(ahub, dataprovider == "UCSC")
#hg_cpg <- query(ahub_s, "CpG")
#hg_cpg <- hg_cpg[[1]]
#DNase_cpg <- subsetByOverlaps(hg_cpg, qah_h1)
# ov <- subsetByOverlaps(DNase_cpg, RGset_data)
gr <- GRanges(RGset_data)
ov <- subsetByOverlaps(gr, qah_h1)
